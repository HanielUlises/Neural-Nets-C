# Neural-Nets-C

This repository contains implementations and experiments with neural networks in C, focusing on educational purposes. The project demonstrates fundamental concepts of neural networks through a modular codebase that includes linear algebra utilities.

## Features

- Supports multiple neural network architectures, including feedforward and deep neural networks.
- Supports different optimizers (SGD, Momentum, Adam).
- Offers several activation functions (ReLU, Sigmoid, TanH).
- Includes loss functions and regularization techniques.
- Linear algebra utilities for matrix and vector operations.

## Linear Algebra Functions

The `lin_alg.h` header file provides essential functions for matrix and vector manipulations, including:

- **Weighted Sum**: `multiple_in_single_out`, computes the weighted sum of inputs.
- **Matrix-Vector Multiplication**: `matrix_vector_multiplication`, multiplies a matrix by a vector.
- **Matrix-Matrix Multiplication**: `matrix_matrix_multiplication`.
- **Transpose Matrix**: `transpose_matrix`.
- **Vector Operations**: Includes dot product, addition, subtraction, and scalar multiplication.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- A C compiler (e.g., GCC)
- Make (optional, for building)

### Installation
